# jekyll-magic
This package is primarily being developed to aid my own workflow and none of the existing packages seemed to fully satisfy my needs.
This project is, however, heavily inspired by many awesome folks sharing their work: [easy-jekyll](https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-jekyll), [Hyde](https://github.com/nibrahim/Hyde), and [Magit](https://github.com/magit/magit).
